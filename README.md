# Ultimate-Calculator
## About
This is a calculator that encompasses much more than what a graphing calculator has. It can implement formulae, estimate constants, graph functions, and do arithmetic.

## Skills used
* Object Oriented Programming
  * Classes
  * Polymorphism
  * Global Variables
* Script Engines
* Packages
* Advanced Mathematic Concepts

## Why?
Something that I've noticed is that when we use mathematical formulas on tests, we don't truly grasp the reason as to why these formulas are what they are. The goal of my task is to change that. My plan is to make a calculator that can calculate formulas based on user inputs, but it will show how it got to that point and why this formula can be used to get the answer.

I would like to emphasize with my model of the calculator is that it is very important to not only know how to use a formula or method in mathematics, but also to fully understand what it is and why it is. For example, everyone knows what Pythagorean's theorum is, but few know why a^2 + b^2 is equal to c^2. This is actually proven because by taking a square with side length c and rotating it some degrees so that the vertices are touching the sides of a larger square with side length a+b, a and b being divided where the smaller square touches the larger square, the squares will naturally appear when considering the area of a square. 

It just blows me away how all mathematics can be proven and fit so perfectly together, like puzzle pieces, and I want the user to be able to have a better grasp on these concepts after they use my calculator.
